# Introduction
This project is forked from the [iReader]( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ireader/ppelffpjgkifjfgnbaaldcehkpajlmbc).

Its SVN repo is here: http://ireader-extension.googlecode.com/

There is a forked version: https://github.com/svn2github/ireader-extension

The [iReader extension]( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ireader/ppelffpjgkifjfgnbaaldcehkpajlmbc) itself is awesome, and it help me a lot.

The last update of iReader is April 7, 2012. And apparently the author Mhd Hejazi stop maintain this extension since 2012.
But there're some inconvenience when I use this extension.

For example:
* it doesn't support [cVim](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh?hl=en).
* it's incompatible with some websites it should support like [this](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17277_02/html/GettingStartedGuide/indexes.html),
I have another extension [Reader Mode](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-mode/ihgjiapheabakagbnbaminbheoihgajn) to handle such pages,
but the Reader Mode can only handle simple webpage, both extensions can not handle websites like [Reuters Chinese](http://cn.reuters.com/).
* incompatible with other extensions like [Google Dictionary](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja) which lots of user requested in chrome web store.

# TODO
1. support other extensions, at least cVim and Google Dictionary
2. add custom ```css``` support for those users needed custom colors, fonts, sizes, etc.
3. support more webpages/website (this may take long time)
